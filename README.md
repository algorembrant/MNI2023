Hi, I am the author of **Malamig na Init (MNI)** uploaded on [Wattpad](https://www.wattpad.com/story/362742718-malamig-na-init-engv). I wrote that in high school with **no** AI! *(I’m dumb)*, if you wanna see the draft containing raw story lines then kindly visit my [GDoc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gTzn-B1pSLE7FtlTjj7bPfb-XMCmcOlXOTnIAL_uTKY/edit?tab=t.0) where I manually typed 42,425 words! Lmao, just for the draft. And the final one became approximately 2x, LOL.

# Malamig na Init (MNI) – Synopsis

*"Who would ever think that a cliché scenery would happen, yet it is meant to be,"* someone once said.  

*"A selfish decision that costs worldly sacrifice to save the unknown fellows. Even if the innocent oppose me, their future will still appreciate it. But for now, they will not,"* added a mullet-haired man with tattoos, carrying an unconscious child on his shoulder. *"Maybe they will see me as a devil, despite my righteousness."*  

He murmured, *"I sometimes dislike myself when I think too much… ahhhh… shit,"* before finally removing his anti-radioactive suit.  

Then, the world changed forever. A meteor, undetected by satellites, struck the center of the Pacific, wiping out most of the ocean and leaving only thirty-six percent behind. The Earth bore a [**massive dark spot**](https://i.pinimg.com/564x/8b/8d/30/8b8d30a4292343b4cb506fe5e307b1dc.jpg). Extreme heat evaporated the remaining water, combining with gases in the atmosphere, and [**Deserts**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cA6xCEYKl0QZ-A8hgn4wxRUjWh9JcbX2WpDUdUfKshQ/edit) spread across the planet. **Rain**, once a symbol of life and hope, became a deadly phenomenon. It transformed living beings, including humans, into savage monsters, ravenous for blood and flesh, stripping away their humanity.  

Everyone wished it were a dream. But why was it a nightmare instead? Waking up would be a denied fantasy.  

A year after the meteor, both monsters and humans had evolved drastically. Soldiers modified their military suits to confront creatures one hundred times their size. These hunters, called Bounty Hunters or **Chasseurs**, claim bounties in a world where adaptation had become unnatural. Perhaps an unknown entity is responsible, but it is not Divine.  

[**Humans**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fsZ8JY3FiJwC8UIQMLLl2bYxJhs-J_xM_8ZyGD1XA2k/edit) discovered ways to enhance their gear and weapons using monster corpses, enabling them to combat [**Monster Beasts**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1I3amau5LV80h4AHWTo9vEKcCWVpg87B0kUrp0o_UcHU/edit) like [**Mongrels**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-fc2DhkZjsfXW5TX8__hmSeLm9huEOC1dxSMgyOMhyE/edit) and mythical creatures such as [**Baqunawa**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JXxgFlXK3pO63_T9ImyICOnCwCvkzY2PZz3wgKWXV08/edit), [**Adarna**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nnnu8bdNWcDKuv_sKUb3zozTMS6VGttD5wIwvJq8-vA/edit), [**El Geqqu**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kiz6fbupFzZZJH2zv_1XSq_8qf42G-lBbFZV3y_jm9c/edit), and [**Leviathan**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EVrJNKM-mIhB_-JOZPqStx-cuIm3bnXEDMyYj8Erdyk/edit). Artificial Intelligence brought specimens to life, creating Bio-Technologies called [**Drifters**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/186P2Dh8gt0AhgzvOK5IKSUCi8X5tRm4n1SdNa-om4x4/edit), capable of rivaling or surpassing human intelligence. Illegal experiments produced Mongrel soldiers, often resulting in [**Fallen Orions**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ss9ZcesYX00FbVcXbq34yq1mfH5S00JOIJlKuUc8zSw/edit), while [**Anakis**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZrPV5UTQwh3XK1l4M_2rM0hTQb_ttkZCaCwnLftGjrw/edit), beings who can shift, resist temptation, and control great power, remained mysterious.  

The world soon discovered **True-Humans**, beings not of Earth, with ash-gray hair, glowy warm-peach skin, and striking orange-obsidian eyes. They seemed almost godlike. Yet appearances were deceiving. Humans, famed for their beauty, could be monstrous, while some monsters showed kindness. In this confusing new reality, trust became the rarest phenomenon. Your only true ally might be yourself. Forgiving is easy, but believing again may lead to betrayal.  

*"Everything happens for a reason, and it is written for a purpose,"* whispered the voice of a **Sybil**.  

Questions linger. Why did the meteor strike undetected? Why has the rain turned deadly? Who crafted these weapons and modified monsters? Who manipulates memories? And most importantly, who are you? The line between human and monster is blurred, and survival demands answers, courage, and the realization that the world may never be as simple as it once was.
